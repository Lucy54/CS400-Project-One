John lives in Colorado and works as a baker. He owns a bakery near his house and lives with a pet dog. One afternoon, he decided to take his dog for a walk
and drove to a dog park half an hour from his house. The sky appeared cloudy, but he headed down the trail and planned to make a loop around the lake. Ten
minutes into his walk, he noticed a few water droplets and started to head back, but he realized that he could not find his keys.

Suddenly, a loud thunder striked, his dog ran as fast as possible as John was unable to grab the leash on time. As he chases after his dog, he suddenly rem-
bered that he left his key on the bench on the park when he was using it to gather his dog's attention while they were playing together. In the meantime, his 
dog was still running uncontrollably towards the opposite direction of the park. John, stood hopelessly and tirelessly in the rain, wonders whether he should 
go back to the park to get his key first (afraid someone might steal it) or to continue chasing after his dog.
