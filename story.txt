John lives in Colorado and works as a baker. He owns a bakery near his house and lives with a pet dog. One afternoon, he decided to take his dog for a walk
and drove to a dog park half an hour from his house. The sky appeared cloudy, but he headed down the trail and planned to make a loop around the lake. Ten
minutes into his walk, he noticed a few water droplets and started to head back, but he realized that he could not find his keys.
